Spring Microservices refers to the implementation of the microservices architectural style using the Spring ecosystem, particularly Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

Microservices Architecture:
This architectural approach structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability, can be developed and deployed independently, and communicates with other services through lightweight mechanisms, often using RESTful APIs.

Spring Boot for Microservices:
Spring Boot is widely considered the de facto standard for building Java microservices due to its features that simplify development and deployment:

Stand-alone applications: Spring Boot allows creation of self-contained, executable JARs with embedded servers, eliminating the need for external application servers.

Opinionated defaults: It provides sensible default configurations, reducing boilerplate code and enabling quick project setup.

Production-ready features: Spring Boot includes features for monitoring, health checks, and externalized configuration, essential for production deployments.

Spring Cloud for Microservices:
While Spring Boot helps build individual microservices, Spring Cloud provides a set of tools and patterns to manage the challenges of a distributed microservices environment:

Service Discovery: Components like Eureka enable services to register themselves and discover other services dynamically.
API Gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway (or previously Netflix Zuul) acts as a single entry point for clients, routing requests to appropriate services and handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication and rate limiting.
Load Balancing: Ribbon (often used with Eureka) provides client-side load balancing for service calls.
Circuit Breakers: Hystrix (or Resilience4j) helps build fault-tolerant systems by preventing cascading failures in distributed environments.
Distributed Configuration: Spring Cloud Config Server provides centralized configuration management for all microservices.

Benefits of Spring Microservices:
Scalability: Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.
Resilience: Failures in one service are less likely to affect the entire application.
Faster Development and Deployment: Smaller, independent services allow for quicker development cycles and more frequent deployments.
Technology Heterogeneity: Different services can be built using different technologies if needed.
Easier Maintenance: Smaller codebases are easier to understand and maintain.
